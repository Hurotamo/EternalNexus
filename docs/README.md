## üõ†Ô∏è **Prerequisites**

* [NASM][nasm]
* **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed for any frontend dependencies.

## Building
ETERNAL NEXUS uses Cargo for building (this is included with Rust by default). To build the full project, you can run `cargo build` in the root directory to build the project. This will also run the build script for each project, which invokes [NASM][nasm] to modify the binaries.

## üìû **Troubleshooting Tips**
- If you encounter issues during the build process, ensure that your Rust toolchain is up to date and that NASM is properly installed.
- Refer to the main README.md for additional setup instructions and troubleshooting tips.
